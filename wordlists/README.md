A series of lists I created from various sources.

- movie-titles.list contains TV, Movie, and some video game titles. The list was de-duplicated and individual episode titles were stripped out. May not be a completely exhaustive list of these categories of entertainment.

- movie-titles-nospace.list as above with all spaces between words removed.

- media-characters.list contains TV, Movie, and some video game characters/roles. The list was de-duplicated and some (but not all) generic character references were removed/minimized. There are possibly some gaps to be filled here or areas of clean-up required.

- media-characters-nospaces.list as above with all spaces between words removed.

- albums.list contains list of mostly rock and pop style album titles

- albums-nospaces.list same as above without the spaces

- musical-artists.list list of mostly rock and pop type artists and groups

- musical-artists-nospaces.list same as above without the spaces
